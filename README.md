# Advent 🎄✨

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code** and **Advent of TypeScript**, all written in TypeScript. 🎅🧑‍🎄 Use the CLI included in the repo to run and test the solutions.

## Installation 🎁

Make sure you have **pnpm** installed, then clone this repository and navigate to its directory.

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Usage 🛷

Run the CLI using the `dev` command and specify one of the subcommands:

### Advent of Code ❄️

```bash
pnpm dev aoc -y <year> <file>
```

- `-y, --year`: Specify the year (defaults to the current year).
- `<file>`: The challenge file number to execute (e.g., `1`, `03`).

Example:

```bash
pnpm dev aoc -y 2023 01
```

### Advent of TypeScript 🌟

```bash
pnpm dev aot -y <year> <file>
```

- `-y, --year`: Specify the year (defaults to the current year).
- `<file>`: The TypeScript file number to check (e.g., `2`, `04`).
